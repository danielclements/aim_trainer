# Aim_Trainer

Aim_Trainer is my second milestone project as part of The Code Institute curriculum, This project idea came to me whilst playing csgo and realizing i needed to get better at aiming, so i thought to my self "What could be better than making my own aim training game!".

Click the targets that appear on screen , make sure your fast they wont wait around for ever !
The game will not only improve your reacion time but will help improve hand to eye coordination.

## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- In the future I plan to add a alternate game mode that will focus on hitting as many tagets in a row as          possible. The aim of this mode will be to get the highest hit count possible , as soon as one target is missed   the game mode will end.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - The project uses **HTML 5** to write the front end of the website.

- [CSS 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
    - This project uses **CSS 3** to style the front end of the website.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to improve dom manipulation with in javascript.  

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com)
    - This project uses **Bootstrap** to improve scaling to mobile and decrease development time

- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
    - This project uses **Sketch** to create mockups / wireframes.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - this project uses font awesome to display a few icons in the title and the targets.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

## Bugs

- Intro music on index page and battle music on aim_trainer dont always play when the page is loaded.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This site is hosted on github pages.The page is being hosted directly from the master branch, that way any updates that are committed will be updated straight away.  
By using the file name `index.html` github pages knows what file to display as the main page, with out this you GP wont know what to display.
